## Description

This Portfolio was built using the ReactJS Framework. It includes links to various other projects I've worked on, as well relevant employer information and avenues to get in touch. While the Portfolio itself only demonstrates a few useful skills individually, the various other projects linked within display a broad spectrum of talents from Back-End Data Structuring, Route Networking, and work done in multiple relevant coding languages. Prospective employers can find by Portfolio by clicking [Here](https://aesthetic-justice.github.io/ReactJS-Portfolio/)
